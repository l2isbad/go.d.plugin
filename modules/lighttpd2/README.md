### configuration

Needs only `url` to server's `server-status?format=plain`

Here is an example for 2 servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url : http://localhost/server-status?format=plain
      
  - name: remote
    url : http://100.64.0.1/server-status?format=plain
```

Without configuration, module attempts to connect to `http://localhost/server-status?format=plain`
